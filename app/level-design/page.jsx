          Single-Player Mission Design
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
          The single-player campaign consists of linear missions structured to deliver a cinematic experience, with each level designed to reflect the narrative’s intensity and stakes. Missions vary in tone, pacing, and objectives, ensuring a diverse gameplay experience.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
          <li>
            <strong>Linear Progression with Dynamic Elements</strong>: Missions like “Crew Expendable” use tight, scripted paths on a cargo ship to create tension, while dynamic events (e.g., explosions, enemy ambushes) keep players engaged.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Varied Environments</strong>: Levels span multiple settings, such as the Middle Eastern city in “War Pig,” the Chernobyl ruins in “All Ghillied Up,” and a Russian missile base in “Game Over,” each with unique layouts and challenges.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pacing and Intensity</strong>: Missions alternate between high-action sequences (e.g., “Shock and Awe”) and stealth-focused sections (e.g., “All Ghillied Up”), maintaining player engagement through contrast.

          Multiplayer Map Design
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
          Multiplayer maps are designed for balanced, competitive play, supporting various game modes like Team Deathmatch and Search and Destroy. Each map offers distinct layouts to encourage strategic play.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
          <li>
            <strong>Map Variety</strong>: Maps like “Crash” (urban rooftop setting) and “Shipment” (small container yard) cater to different playstyles, from long-range sniping to close-quarters combat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flow and Chokepoints</strong>: Maps feature chokepoints and open areas to balance offense and defense. For example, “Overgrown” has open fields for snipers but dense foliage for stealth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Verticality</strong>: Many maps, such as “Crossfire,” incorporate vertical elements like rooftops and elevated positions, adding depth to engagements.

          <li>
            <strong>Destruction and Chaos</strong>: “Shock and Awe” features a Middle Eastern city ravaged by war, with burning vehicles and crumbling buildings underscoring the nuclear devastation.
